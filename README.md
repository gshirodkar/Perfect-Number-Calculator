# Perfect Number Calculator

This is a *extremely* simple program to calculate perfect numbers using the java programming language.

A _perfect number_ is a number whose factors add up to the number itself.

For example, 6 and 28 are both perfect numbers as the factors of 6 are 2,3, and 1. (2+3+1=6)

And the Factors of 28 are 2+14+4+7+1=28.

**Just a quick notice!**
The program uses the double precision numbers so the only number it can go up to is somewhere around 1.7*10^308. After that, it should spit out an error and quit. But since the program is NOT optimized, its pretty slow. 

***_Quick Update_***
I have been working on a bigInteger update, which can store up to about 2<sup>2<sup>37</sup></sup> bits of data. 

If you reach this limit, you deserve a prize! Email me at the site shown on the website, and Ill give you a prize (maybe). :)


***Where to get the latest release?***

I recently uploaded the lastest build of my program. The build uses the master branch, so (hopefully) no bugs. The current master branch causes issues, which I am currently working on, the builds however, are fine. They lack the bigInteger implementation though.

Heres a link to it.

Have fun calculating numbers!
