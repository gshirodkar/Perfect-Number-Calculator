# Perfect-Number-Calculator for VERY LARGE NUMBERS
A (very) simple method to calculate perfect numbers using the java programming language.

A Perfect number is a number whose factors add up to the number itself.

For example 6 and 28 are both perfect numbers as the factors of 6 are 2,3, and 1. (2+3+1=6)

as the Factors of 28 are 2+14+4+7+1=28.

The program uses the double precision numbers so the only number it can go up to is somewhere around 1.7*10^308. After that, it should spit out an error and quit. I am working on this issue right now. (As shown in the issues panel)
